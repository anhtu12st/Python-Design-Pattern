# Composite
- Objects can use other objects via inheritance/composition
- Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors
- Composite design pattern lets us treat both types of objects uniformly
- Python supports iteration with __iter__ the IterableABC
- A single object can make itself iterable by yielding self from __iter__
