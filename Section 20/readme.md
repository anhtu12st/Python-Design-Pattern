# State Pattern
- A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state. An object transitions from one state to another (something needs to trigger a transition)
- a formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine

- Given sufficient complexity, it pays  to formally define possible states and events/triggers
- Can define:
- State entry/exit behaviors
- Action when a particular event causes a transition
- Guard conditions enabling/disabling a transition
- Default action when no transitions are found for an event
