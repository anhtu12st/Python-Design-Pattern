# Interpreter Patter
- A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into separate lexical tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens (parsing)
- Lexing turns  text into a set of tokens
- Parsing tokens into meaningful constructs
- Parsed data can then be traversed
