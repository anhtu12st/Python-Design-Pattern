# Command Pattern
- An object which represents an instruction to perform a particular action. Contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken
- Encapsulate all details of an operation in a separate object
- Define instruction for applying the command (either in the command itself, or elsewhere)
- Optionally define instructions for undoing the command
- Can create composite commands (macros)
