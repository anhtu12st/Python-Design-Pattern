# Template Method Pattern
- Allows us to define the 'skeleton' of the algorithm, with concrete implementations defined in subclasses
- Define an algorithm at a high level in parent class
- Define constituent parts as abstract methods/properties
- Inherit the algorithm class, providing necessary overrides
