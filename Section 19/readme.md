# Observer Pattern
- An observer is an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system. The entity generating the events is an observable
- Observer is an intrusive approach: an observable must provide an event to subscribe to
- Subscription and unsubscription handled with addition/removal of items in a list
- Property notifications are easy; dependent property notifications are tricky
