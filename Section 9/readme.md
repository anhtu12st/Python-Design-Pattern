# Decorator Pattern
- Facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects without inheriting from them.
- A decorator keeps the reference to the decorated object(s)
- Adds utility attributes and methods to augment the object's features
- May or may not forward calls to the underlying object
- Proxying of underlying calls can be done dynamically
- Python's functional decorators wrap functions; no direct relation to the GoF Decorator pattern
